        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://vietocr.sourceforge.net/training.html">jTessBoxEditor</a> is a box
            editor for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract OCR data</a>,
            providing editing of box data of both Tesseract 2.0x and 3.0x formats. It can read
            common image formats, including multi-page TIFF.
        </p>
        <h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Runtime
                Environment 6.0</a> or later.
        </p>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Double-click on the JAR file to launch the program, or execute the following command:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <tt>java -Xms128m -Xmx512m -jar jTessBoxEditor.jar</tt>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You will need to provide the TIFF/Box files as input to the program. Images to be
            used in training should be of 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit per pixel) black&amp;white
            or 8 bpp grayscale, uncompressed TIFF format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The box files, encoded in UTF-8 format, are generated by Tesseract executables with
            appropriate command-line options (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/w/list">Tesseract Wiki</a>). The training operation can be automated using the enclosed
            <tt>train.ps1</tt> Windows PowerShell script.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the coordinate system used in the box file has (0,0) at the bottom-left;
            on computer graphics devices, however, (0,0) is defined as top-left. jTessBoxEditor
            uses and displays in the graphics device coordinates. The edited box files are still
            read and written in proper format.
        </p>
        <p>
            A conversion function is included to convert numeric character reference (NCR) and
            escape sequence in the <em>Character</em> text field to Unicode characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Merge TIFF</em> function can save multiple images containing text of the
            same font into a single multi-page TIFF file to be used for training.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Generate TIFF/Box</em> function generates, for a given input UTF-8 text
            file, a TIFF/Box pair of files suitable for training with Tesseract. The generated
            image is, depending on anti-aliasing mode enabled, a binary or grayscale, uncompressed multi-page TIFF with 300-DPI resolution.
            Letter tracking, or spacing between characters, can be adjusted by the <em>Tracking</em>
            spinner control to eliminate bounding box overlapping issues. Note that the coordinates
            of some boxes could be slightly different (by 1 or 2 pixels) from the ones that
            would have been generated by Tesseract itself; nevertheless, the generated box file
            can be used to validate the one created by Tesseract with the use of a Unicode-compatible
            file compare tool, such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winmerge/">WinMerge</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="auto-style1">Tips</span>: Experiments indicate that the quality of training with images created by <em>Generate TIFF/Box</em> is higher with font sizes 24pt or greater.</p>
        <p>
            Combining symbols or diacritics, like those found in Devanagari or Indic scripts, that need to be combined with the main, base character can be specified by the user in a UTF-8 text file, specifically <tt>data/combiningsymbols.txt</tt>, which is read by <em>Generate TIFF/Box</em> function. This setup gives the users the flexibility in defining combining symbols/diacritics for their language scripts.</p>
