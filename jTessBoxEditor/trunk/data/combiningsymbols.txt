# Define combining symbols/diacritics
# The file, which is UTF-8 encoded, contains symbols, diacritics, or characters,
# in Unicode native or escaped forms such as U+0CCC or \u00CC.
# that need to be combined with the preceding main/base character.
# Comment lines start with # sign. The value should be on one single line, with no spaces or quotes.
# If it's empty, the combining step will be bypassed. "-" character represents ranges.
# Ex: "U+0CCC-U+0CCC\u00CC" (without the quotes)
\u0C82\u0C83\u0CBE\u0CBF\u0CC0-\u0CCC
