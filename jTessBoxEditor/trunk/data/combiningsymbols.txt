# Specify combining symbols/diacritics
# The user-defined UTF-8 encoded text file contains symbols, diacritics, or characters,
# in Unicode native or escaped forms, such as U+0CCC or \u0CCC,
# that need to be combined with the preceding main/base character.
# Comment lines start with # sign. The value should be on one single line, with no spaces or quotes.
# If it's empty, the combining step will be bypassed. "-" character represents ranges.
# E.g.: "U+0CCA-U+0CCC\u0CC9" (without the quotes)
#\u0C82\u0C83\u0CBE\u0CBF\u0CC0-\u0CCC
