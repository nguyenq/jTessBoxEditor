# This UTF-8 encoded text file lets the user specify combining symbols or diacritics
# in Unicode native or escaped forms, such as U+0CCC or \u0CCC,
# that need to be combined with the preceding main/base character.
# Comment lines start with # sign. All the codepoint values should be on one single line, 
# with no spaces or quotes. A dash "-" character indicates a range of values.
# For example, uncomment the following line to combine specified symbols/diacritics for Devanagari or Indic scripts.
#\u0C82\u0C83\u0CBE\u0CBF\u0CC0-\u0CCC
