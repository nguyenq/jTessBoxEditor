            DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://vietocr.sourceforge.net/training.html">jTessBoxEditor</a> is a box
            editor for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract OCR data</a>,
            providing editing of box data of both Tesseract 2.0x and 3.0x formats. It can read
            common image formats, including multi-page TIFF.</p>
        <h3>
            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Runtime
                Environment 6.0</a> or later.</p>
        <h3>
            INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Double-click on the JAR file to launch the program, or execute the following command:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <tt>java -jar jTessBoxEditor.jar</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            You will need to provide the Tiff/box files as input to the program. Images to be
            used in training should be of 300 DPI and 1 bpp (bit per pixel) black&amp;white
            or 8 bpp grayscale, uncompressed TIFF format.</p>
        <p>
            The box files, encoded in UTF-8 format, are generated by Tesseract executables with
            appropriate command-line options (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/w/list">
                Tesseract Wiki</a>). The training operation can be automated using the enclosed
            <tt>train.ps1</tt> Windows PowerShell script.</p>
        <p>
            Note that the coordinate system used in the box file has (0,0) at the bottom-left;
            on computer graphics devices, however, (0,0) is defined as top-left. jTessBoxEditor
            uses and displays in the graphics device coordinates. The edited box files are still
            read and written in proper format.</p>
        <p>
            A conversion function is included to convert numeric character reference (NCR) and
            escape sequence in the <em>Character</em> text field to Unicode characters.</p>
        <p>
            The <em>Merge TIFF</em> function can save multiple images containing text of the
            same font into a single multi-page TIFF file to be used for training.</p>
        <p>
            The <em>Generate TIFF/Box</em> function generates, for a given input text file,
            a TIFF/Box pair of files, which can then be used in the training process. Note that
            some boxes could be slightly different from ones that would have been generated
            by Tesseract. You may want to verify and edit the generated box file before continuing with
            the training.</p>
